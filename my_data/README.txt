When running this script, it will only output .csv files. So you'll have to manually open them one by one in Excel if you wanna save them as .xlsx files.
Though for submission, I will already have included the .xlsx files so don't worry about that.

Also I used semicolons (;) as the delimiter cause using commas mess things up so keep that in mind when opening this file via whatever.
And if you're wondering, the 'sep=;' at the start of every .csv file is just an Excel thing so that it formats properly. I can't really do much about that. If you're not using Excel, look up how to change delimiters when opening the file and remove the 'sep=;' line at every csv file.
